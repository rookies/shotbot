ShotBot Notes
=============

## Pumping system
* Experiment 2019-11-08
  * peristaltic valve works great
  * servo should be shut off when it's in a static position
  * bottle pipe adapter leaks between the connectors, but epoxy fixes it
  * extra valve to release the pressure is probably a good idea
  * Open questions
    * Is the amount of liquid dispensed constant?
